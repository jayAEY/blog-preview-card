## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I made this in about an hour. I would like to try making similar pages in the future with tailwind or bootstrap. I find them helpful for certain things, but as of right now, I'm alot more comfortable with regular CSS.
